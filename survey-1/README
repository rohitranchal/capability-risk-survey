Instruction to setup the application in your local machine
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prerequisits:
- Apache web server
- Mysql
- PHP

The webserver must be configured to be able to process php and php has 
access to mysql functions.

Please follow the following steps:

1.) Create an empty database in your local mysql server called cap_risk.
2.) Use the db.sql to create the tables.

3.)
Update the instances where the user/password is used in mysqli_connect() in the 
following files: (Yes ... I will move it to one place later :P)
- index.php
- process.php
- tables.php

4.) Copy all .php files into a directory in the web root of the web server.

5.) Restart the web server if not started.

THAT'S IT!!!
Enjoy :-)
